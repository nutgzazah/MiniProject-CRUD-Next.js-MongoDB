## Overview

This is my mini project, where I practiced coding skills using **Next.js** with **MongoDB** as the backend. I implemented **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations.

## Installation

In Terminal.
```bash
npm install
```
After installation, the project will be ready in final step.
```bash
npm run dev
```
After npm run dev, the program should be executed properly!!
